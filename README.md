# SpellingQuiz

## Purpose

This script helps automate the generation of Spelling Quizzes by pull from a bank of spelling words categorized by grade level found in the Spelling_Lists folder. Every time the script is ran, the chosen words are then removed from the related grade level spelling list file while the full list of words are stored in the Master_Lists folder.
